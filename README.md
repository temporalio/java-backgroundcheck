# Java: Background Check

Demonstrate the use of Temporal Cloud authentication in a worker.

## Notes

**'Background' background**

This material was originally developed for our [Dev Guide](https://docs.temporal.io/dev-guide/java/foundations#connect-to-temporal-cloud). It's now ported into its own repo so the material can be synced into new feature documentation content.

**Testing Packages**

Each Temporal SDK has a testing suite that can be used in conjunction with a typical language specific testing framework. In the Temporal Java SDK, the [`testing` package](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/io.temporal/temporal-testing/latest/index.html) offers a test environment in which the Workflow and Activity code may be run for test purposes. While Temporal supports both JUnit4 and JUnit5 packages, our examples use [JUnit5](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/io.temporal/temporal-testing-junit5/latest/index.html).
